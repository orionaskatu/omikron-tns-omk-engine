//
//   * the texel is the material's own pixel units WRAPPED, which is what lets
//     one atlas tile across a wall - so the UVs arrive unnormalised and are
//     divided by textureSize here, with the sampler set to REPEAT;
//   * the baked vertex value is a COLOUR and multiplies the texel (ASSETS 4c);
//     38.9% of set vertices are not grey, and reading one byte as a brightness
//     renders every set in monochrome, which was this repo's own bug;
//   * `cutout` is flag 0x800 - a COLOUR KEY on black, the engine's
//     SetRenderState(27, 1) arm - and never alpha;
//   * the fog is linear over the clip distance's range, the CPU having
//     already applied the bucket key's exclusions (`renderer.h`, the View).
