// THE RENDERER BOUNDARY - at the DECISION level, which is `PORTING` A2 and
// the load-bearing design decision in Part A.
//
// A2 in one sentence: **a backend receives decisions and turns them into API
// calls; it never makes one.** What `engine/` has ported is not triangles, it
// is the decisions around them - the drawable mask `flags & 0x800043`, the
// 14-bit bucket key, the texture slot as that key's LOW SIX BITS, the two
// blend modes (`0x1000|0x2000` additive, `0x1000|0x4000` multiply, `0x800`
// cutout), the 58-slot name-keyed texture cache, and the visible-set walk
// against `sub_48D0D0`'s frustum. Every one of those is checked. Put the
// boundary at the Vulkan level instead and they leak into a backend where
// nothing can check them, which A2 says is annoying to retrofit and is exactly
// the mistake this file exists to avoid.
//
// So the interface is A2's, near enough verbatim:
//
//     init(w, h)                 the framebuffer's size
//     setTextures(span)          the resident pool, indexed by material
//     begin(View)                the camera and its frustum
//     submit(Draw)               {bucketKey, geometry, range, blend, cutout}
//     end()                      the frame is finished
//     readback() -> Surface      RGB565, for a check to look at
//
// TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS, ONE BOUNDARY (`PORTING` A1):
//
//   * `SoftwareRenderer` (below, over `raster.cpp`) is the REFERENCE - the one
//     `verify.py` checks, and the one every claim in `docs/` about the 3D path
//     is a claim about. It is not a port: the engine has no software 3D
//     rasterizer, D3D drew every triangle (`raster.h`, `PORTING` B6).
//   * the Vulkan backend is the LIVE one, in `backends/vulkan/`, and like SDL
//     it is optional - `make` and the whole suite must pass on a machine with
//     no Vulkan SDK at all, which is A1's closing sentence and A8 rule 1.
//
// **`readback()` is what makes the pair testable rather than merely parallel.**
// A GPU frame that can only be looked at is a frame nobody can difference, and
// this repo has spent two sessions learning what an unverifiable render costs.
// The Vulkan backend copies its colour attachment back to an RGB565 `Surface`
// on request - slow, and never on a frame being played, but it means the live
// renderer and the reference one can be compared with the same instrument that
// compares the reference against the engine's own captures.
//
// **What is NOT here, and deliberately.** A2's interface also lists
// `submit2d(I2dList)`. The 2D layer is not on this boundary yet: the ported
// I2D path already reproduces the engine's framebuffer exactly (66560/66560
// over the menu's deterministic region) and a Blt is a memory copy, so there
// is nothing a GPU would make more correct - only faster. The live frontend
// composites it as a texture upload, which is what `backends/sdl/play.cpp`
// already does. Moving it here is a later slice and should say what it buys.

// ------------------------------------------------------------ THE MIRROR PASS
//
// `docs/ASSETS.md` 4c: the game HAS mirrors. Mesh flag
// `0x100000`, 6 meshes of 12203, at most one live at a time (the engine keeps
// a single global, `dword_534F48`), and `sub_440D90` - called once a frame
// from the camera setup path - reflects the camera through the mirror's plane
// and calls the scene draw AGAIN.
//
// What is traced, and each of these is implemented below rather than invented:
//
//   * the camera is reflected through the plane, `p -= 2 * dist * n`, both the
//     eye and the target;
//   * the pass is SKIPPED when the camera is behind the plane
//     (`if (v11 > 0.0)`), so a mirror seen from the back costs nothing;
//   * the reflected pass draws with screen X FLIPPED. `Raster_DrawTriangles`
//     computes `v143 - x` instead of `v140 + x` while the pass flag is set,
//     which compensates the handedness flip a reflection introduces. That is
//     exactly what `RCamera::mirror` does - the control kept to show the
//     flipped camera reading differs is the operation the mirror pass
//     genuinely needs;
//   * the mirror mesh itself is BLENDED over the result, which is why one
//     shipped mirror is additive and another multiply without either being an
//     anomaly - the blend is the compositing operator, not a substitute for a
//     reflection.
//
// **How the engine confines the reflection is DRAW ORDER AND DEPTH** (read,
// `docs/ASSETS.md` 4c): `sub_440D90` draws the reflected frame, then the real
// one with nothing cleared between, so the real pass's nearer surfaces cover
// the virtual room everywhere but the mirror's opening. The GLES and Vulkan
// backends draw it exactly so (`drawMirrorScene`). THIS function - the CPU
// fallback, the software reference's path - composites through a MASK
// instead: the mirror's own corners are drawn alone to find which pixels it
// covers, and the reflection is taken there and nowhere else. The mask is a
// RECONSTRUCTION, kept because it runs on any backend; it differs from the
// engine's way by its read-back's dither and by a far object the mask lets
// through where the depths would not.
//
