// THE BODIES LIT BY THEIR SURROUNDINGS - the remaster's A5 (`todo/remaster.md`).
// NOT IN THE ORIGINAL: a `[Remaster]` option (`bodylight = S`,
// `--body-light S`), off unless named.
//
// The original starts every lit body from ONE grey, the scene's `+416` (the
// set's ambient, `Draw::lightBase`), and adds the set's lights that reach it;
// the static set is shaded instead by a colour the artists BAKED into every
// vertex (ASSETS 4c). So a character under a neon sign is as grey as one in a
// dark alley. This reads the painted light: the set's own opaque surface,
// its corners' colours interpolated and summed by area into cells at load,
// and around a body the weighted mean of the cells near it - the colour the
// artists gave that place. Brighter than the set's mean colour, a body starts
// from the grey PLUS the departure, `grey + S (probe - mean)` per channel;
// darker, the grey SHADED in proportion, `grey (1 - S (1 - probe / mean))` -
// `mean` the probe's mean at body height over the set's floors - so the
// city's average character keeps the original's grey and only the
// DEPARTURES - a neon, a dark corner - carry over, in brightness and hue.
// (Brightening is added, not multiplied: a set's grey can be nearly black -
// Anekbah's is 10 of 255 - and its lamps outweigh any multiple of it.
// Darkening is multiplied: added, it took a body by a fire to black.) It
// reaches the renderer as a TINT of the grey, `Draw::lightTint`. No light is added; the set's
// lights still add on top. `--remaster DIR` sets it at 1.
//
// No oracle: the original has no such thing. Tier 6 - the rule's own
// invariants (a uniform set gives a tint of 1 everywhere; the tint is
// continuous as a body walks), checked by `verify.py: engine: body light`.
// Drawn by Vulkan and GLES (`Renderer::setBodyTint`); the software reference,
// GL1 and the 3DS refuse it.
