// THE EMITTERS' LIGHT - the remaster's A5b (`todo/remaster.md`). NOT IN THE
// ORIGINAL: a `[Remaster]` option (`fxlight = S`, `--fx-light S`), off unless
// named.
//
// A set's flames, neon halos and lamp glows are PARTICLES (`o3de/particles.h`,
// the `.sfx` ambient effects): additive sprites that light nothing. The
// original lights a body from its scene's grey and the set's `.3DO` lights
// alone, and none of those sits at a flame - so Kay'l by Anekbah's gas
// burners is as dark as the alley (the reader's play test, 2026-10-20). This
// makes each GLOWING emitter a light of the set's own kind (`Light3do`),
// appended to the slot's table, so every path that lights a body - per vertex
// (`o3de/vertexlight.h`), per pixel (`View::lights`) - takes it unchanged.
//
// Which emitters glow is read from the effect, not its name: ADDITIVE (blend
// mode 4 or 5) and either a STANDING glow - a life of 2 frames or less, one
// sprite re-made on the spot every frame, a lamp's halo (Anekbah's 102
// `neon`, its `cac*`) - or a stream whose SPRITE is saturated, far from grey:
// a flame (`agaz`, its texture's bright texels 0.55). The steam and smoke -
// grey sprites (0.22), long-lived - are not light. The light's colour is the
// sprite's bright texels times the effect's colour ramp; a stream's
// intensity is multiplied by its particles' overlap, sqrt(count x life).
//
// They are POINT lights: the engine's lights shine one fixed direction
// (`normalize(centre - pos)`, `sub_493C30`), a flame shines every way. A
// NEGATIVE inner radius marks one - no shipped record has one - and the
// direction is then taken from the light to the lit point, per body or per
// pixel. The same linear falloff from |inner| to the outer radius.
//
// No oracle (tier 6). Drawn by Vulkan and GLES (`Renderer::setEmitterLights`);
// the software reference, GL1 and the 3DS never get them.
