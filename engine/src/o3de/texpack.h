// THE TEXTURE PACK - the remaster's first feature (`todo/remaster.md` B4).
//
// NOT IN THE ORIGINAL, and not an `[Enhancements]` row either: it replaces
// authored pixels, so it lives under `[Remaster]` (`texturepack = DIR`, or
// `--texture-pack DIR`), OFF unless named. With no pack nothing here runs and
// every backend uploads exactly what it did before.
//
// A pack is a DIRECTORY of `<key>.png` files, `key` the sixteen hex digits of
// `textureKey` below - one file per texture, so a person can open any one of
// them in an image editor and fix it (the curation `todo/remaster.md` B2 and
// B5 need). `tools/omktexpack.py` makes them from the shipped data; nothing a
// pack holds is ever committed (the repo is public, the pixels are not ours).
//
// The KEY is the texture's own content - FNV-1a 64 over its width and height
// (little-endian 32 bits each), its width*height palette indices and its 768
// palette bytes - not its name: 182 names ship with different pixels in
// different files (CLAUDE.md §6). The same bytes in two models are one file.
//
// A replacement must be the original's size times a POWER OF TWO each way
// (1, 2, 4 ... 16), because the shipped UVs are in the ORIGINAL's texels: the
// GLES backend keeps dividing by the original size, the Vulkan shader is told
// the factor. Its ALPHA is the colour key, as `Texture::toRgbaKeyed` makes it
// (0 where the original is cut out, and the colour there 0 too), so a cutout
// mesh (flag 0x800) keeps its silhouette rule.
//
// Drawn by the Vulkan and GLES backends only. The software reference, the
// GL1 and the 3DS backends never consult it: the reference is what the
// original drew, and the two small consoles' textures are the original's size
// rule (`texscale.h`).

// a light map BC4 or ASTC - each with its whole mip chain
// (`tools/tex_encode.cpp`, `omktexpack.py compress`). A backend says which
// it can sample (`setCodecs`); a texture that has one is then READ, not
// decoded - no PNG inflate on the frame it arrives - and uploaded as blocks,
// a quarter of RGBA's memory or less. The PNG, where there is one, stays the
// fallback and the source a person edits; a pack shipped for play may DROP
// its colour and normal PNGs (half its size): the KTX2 then indexes the key,
// and where pixels are wanted (a GL without BPTC, a grey alias) the BC is
